# LAMBDA

A virtual assistant built in Python that I let AI make the code because I'm lazy lol, and also because I'm curious to see if AI can manage to create a virtual assistant.

## Features

* Responds to voice commands.

* Uses Wikipedia for information retrieval.

* Provides text-based responses plus with Text to Speech.

* Can identify its version number. 

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 & Venv installed.

2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`

3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

4. Install dependencies using the virtual environment: `pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 wikipedia pyaudio`

5. Run the assistant: `python3 lambda.py'

## Contact & Extra

If you have any questions and/or problems with my voice assistant, don't hesitate to contact me here on GitHub! :D

For Linux, you will need ALSA (and in future versions, JACK too) working for my voice assistant to work properly.
